### Questions & Answers

### 1. getElementById vs getElementsByClassName vs querySelector / querySelectorAll
ID gets one element, Class gets many, querySelector gets the first match, querySelectorAll gets all matches.  

### 2. Create & Insert Element  
You make it, customize it, and then put it into the page.  

### 3. Event Bubbling
An event starts from the clicked element and moves upward to its parents.  

### 4. Event Delegation 
Put one listener on a parent instead of many on children; saves performance and works for new elements too.  

### 5. preventDefault vs stopPropagation 
preventDefault stops the browserâ€™s normal action, stopPropagation stops the event from spreading to parents.
